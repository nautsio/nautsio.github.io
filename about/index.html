    <h2>Nauts</h2>
    <p>
      Nauts is an initiative by Xebia, and focuses on innovation around Data Center
      automation. New technologies like container based infrastructure and service
      discovery are changing the way Data Centers are automated. The open source
      ecosystem is exploding with new tools every day. Creating a future-proof
      state of the art infrastructure is almost <b>rocket science</b>. That's why you need
      our help.
    </p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
      The Nauts are continuously experimenting with these new tools and stacks. With our
      strict selection process, we make sure the software is suitable for production use.
      This process consists of testing the individual pieces of software, but also a
      comprehensive integration test with our pre-defined stacks. If the software is
      proven to be <b>production-ready</b>, we implement it for our customers together with
      the experienced consultants of Xebia.

    <h3>Sharing knowledge</h3>
    <p>
     As part of our process, we want to share as much knowledge as possible. We do that
     by writing blogs, speaking at conferences and meetups and by creating <a href="/diy">free training material</a>.
     Sharing knowledge is one of our key principles, and is, together with various open source
     contributions, our way of giving back to the community.
