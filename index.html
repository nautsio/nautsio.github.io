                <h4>Solutions</h4>
                <p>Developers love Docker. Containers give them all the freedom to use any language and framework that supports their use case best. But getting that container running in production is still hard.<p/>We can help you with that. Cargonauts are experts in creating container based infrastructures. We have experience with all the new technologies like Docker, Mesos and Kubernetes, but also with legacy technologies like Websphere, JBoss and Puppet.</p>
