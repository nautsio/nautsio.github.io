title: "Towards Docker in production with Apache Mesos"

In this post I will describe a Docker infrastructure based on Apache Mesos. Mesos has been battle-tested and as such qualifies, in my opinion, as one of the more mature infrastructure platforms for running Docker containers across multiple hosts. The goal of this post is to quickly get started and experiment with a production grade Docker infrastructure.
