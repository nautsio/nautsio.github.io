In this innovative talk, Alex and Ren√© give a quick overview of the endless possibilities of Docker on Windows and Linux in combination with ASP.NET 5.

Before today the power of ASP.NET web applications was limited to Windows machines. But now with ASP.NET 5 that limitation is gone by becoming cross-platform. This opens opportunities for new scenarios on different platforms. With the introduction of Windows 2016 it will be possible to do this and deploy and run your application in a Docker container on both Windows and Linux.
