- new things in 0.3-dev and incompatibility
- what we tried to achieve with the setup
  - repeatability
  - multiple stacks
  - simplicity in use
  - cheap setup so can be used for multiple situations
	- ready to go (ie. cluster fully joined, etc.)
- problems with sysdig
- problems with consul (gliderlabs versioning)
- first experiences with gce (setting up was a hassle)
- the initial design
- next steps to make it full featured (vault, ipv6, separate consul, coreos, systemd)
