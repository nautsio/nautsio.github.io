[xhyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve) is a minimal command-line only hypervisor for OS X which makes it ideal for an always-on virtual machine like boot2docker.
This post documents how to get [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io) running in xhyve and contains some quick xhyve vs Virtualbox benchmarks as well.
