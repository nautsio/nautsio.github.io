On March 10th, we hosted a meetup in Pakhuis de Zwijger in Amsterdam on automating modern datacenters. Mitchell Hashimoto of Hashicorp, the creator of tools like Vagrant, Consul and Terraform, joined us and delivered a very interesting talk about his vision on automating datacenters. He also joined us during the hands-on session where we showed how you can use Docker in conjunction with Consul and Vagrant to create production-like load-balanced environments, right on your laptop. 

Also, not in the least thanks to Mark Coleman of [Docker Randstad](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Randstad/), the venue was packed with awesome people.
